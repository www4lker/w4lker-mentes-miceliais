Can you help me to choose a path? write non fiction or autofiction?
You can make some questions if will help

To help you choose between nonfiction and autofiction, consider answering the following questions:

1. What is your primary goal for writing this book? Is it to share your personal experiences and knowledge, or to explore your emotions and experiences through fictional characters and situations?

2. How comfortable are you with sharing personal details about your life and the people in it? Autofiction allows more freedom to protect your privacy and the privacy of others by blending fact and fiction, while nonfiction requires more transparency.

3. Do you feel that your experiences can be more effectively conveyed through a factual or fictional narrative? Consider whether your story would be more engaging and impactful as a true account or a creatively imagined one.

4. How much creative freedom do you want in your writing process? Autofiction provides more room for creative expression and experimentation, while nonfiction generally requires adhering to factual information and a more structured approach.

5. Is your intended audience more interested in learning from your experiences or being entertained by your storytelling? Nonfiction typically appeals to readers seeking knowledge or insight, while autofiction may attract those who enjoy immersive and emotive storytelling.

Reflect on your answers to these questions, and think about which genre aligns more closely with your goals, interests, and personal preferences. Remember that there's no right or wrong choice - both nonfiction and autofiction have their merits, and the best choice for you depends on what you want to achieve with your writing.
