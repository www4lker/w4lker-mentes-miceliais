	KENT 
	Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
	The region of my heart. Be Kent unmannerly
	When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?
	Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
	When power to flattery bows? To plainness honor’s
	bound
	When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state,
	And in thy best consideration check
	This hideous rashness. Answer my life my
	judgment,
	*Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,
	Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sounds
	Reverb no hollowness.*
