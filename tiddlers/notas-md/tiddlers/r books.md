14.  [This was actually a point Brandon Sanderson was trying to make with his recent kickstarter. A quote from his [FAQ about his kickstarter below](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/some-faqs-you-might-enjoy/): I try to listen to my audience.  One thing I’ve heard for years is that readers want to get an ebook with a print book, bundled together.  And I think this is an extremely reasonable request.  The cost to create an ebook once you have the print book is negligible.  Just some basic formatting work.  (This is different from an audiobook, which costs a lot more to host, and needs the paying of a narrator and additional work to put the whole thing together.)  Hollywood often gives you a digital download of a film when you buy the DVD.  Why can’t we get digital copies of books with print ones? I spent years trying to make this happen.  I spent long phone calls with John Sargent, then CEO of Macmillan, arguing with him about what I considered his backward view of ebooks.  (He only recently left, so maybe things can change now.)  He felt that bundling an ebook with a print book would devalue the ebook.  I argued that it’s the text, not the format, that people are paying for.  An ebook is worthless–it’s the text that is worth something. In books, we are lucky in some ways, compared to music, video games, and film.  Physical books are showpieces.  (Calm down, game owners.  I know you like your physical collections of old media too.)  But in general, the public considers physical books to be more collectible than other physical mediums.  They want to own books, display them, feel them. One hallmark of my career has been to make those showpiece print editions as desirable as possible.  Lavish art.  Solid construction.  Extras such as foiling and the like.  I’ve been arguing about this with publishers for years too.  My view is this: bundle the ebook with a nice print edition, and many of them will buy that edition.  We’ll not only have a happy reader more likely to buy from us in the future, but we will also make a little more money in the long run.  We won’t devalue the ebook.  We’ll create an audience who wants to own and display our books–as long as they don’t have to sacrifice the convenience of reading the ebook when they want.](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ujvoug/new_books_should_come_with_a_digital_download/i7mpy8i)
