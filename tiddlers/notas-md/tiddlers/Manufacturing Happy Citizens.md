## DESTAQUES
- Gardner’s thinking, indeed, was not new. On the contrary, it comes out of a deep-seated tradition of mixed ideological, spiritual and popular features that have long fed a powerful market built on the commodification of lifestories of self-change, redemption and personal triumph – a sort of ‘emotional pornography’ aimed at shaping the way people should feel about themselves and the surrounding world.
