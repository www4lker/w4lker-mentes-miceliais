Based on the queries performed on the document, here are the thematically separated notes on Biohacking and Self-tracking:

**1. Biohacking**
   - The term "Biohacking" appears in the book, but the specific context or details are not provided in the search results. It seems to be mentioned in the context of a list of topics or terms, possibly in the index or a glossary. 

**2. Self-Tracking**
   - The book extensively discusses self-tracking. Here are some key points:
     - Self-trackers use data to support "habit hacking," or creating new habits and changing old ones. This process involves identifying what habits need changing, assessing whether current arrangements in the environment are supporting the ultimate goal, and tinkering with new ways of doing things. 
     - Habit hackers are attuned to their environment and how it subtly creates cues for practices that one does largely without deliberate thinking. Many take inspiration from the psychologist and persuasive computing innovator B. J. Fogg, who cultivated a flossing habit by starting to floss one tooth only. This process is called "tiny habits," where triggering small behaviors can lead to change over time.
     - Self-trackers sometimes talk about "chaining" habits together by timing a new habit like doing sit-ups just after a preexisting habit, like drinking coffee, so that they effectively become one long gestureâ€”a morning routine, for example. Psychologists call this "triggering" the behavior, or creating the reminder for an action in the routine.
     - Identifying the cues and routines more clearly can create evidence with which to reflect on what the rewards are really about. This is where self-tracking can help.
