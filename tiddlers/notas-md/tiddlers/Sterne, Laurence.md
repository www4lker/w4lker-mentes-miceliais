### The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman Laurence Sterne (1713–1768) [^1]
#### A Postmodern Masterpiece—from the 1760s

“Nothing odd will do long. Tristram Shandy did not last,” noted Dr. Samuel Johnson, eighteenth-century England’s fiercest literary arbiter. But Johnson was uncharacteristically wrong: Laurence Sterne’s comic masterpiece does last. This antic shaggy dog story firmly established itself during the twentieth century as one of the most admired books ever written. Virginia Woolf, for example, hailed it as “the greatest of all novels,” and Czech writer Milan Kundera praised it for reaching “heights of playfulness, of lightness, never scaled before or since.” Tristram Shandy’s levity is irrepressibly apparent even before you start reading: Flip through the book and you’ll see black pages, marbled pages, blank pages, and typographic oddities that, you’ll discover, are visual counterparts to specific moments in the story. In large part that story turns out to be about Tristram’s difficulty telling it. You might say that his problems begin before he does. Tristram opens his account of his “life and opinions” at the moment of his conception—as it happens, a hilariously mismanaged moment. Though conception seems to be his starting point at first, Tristram soon discovers that “when a man sits down to write a history [. . .] he knows no more than his heels what lets and confounded hindrances he is to meet with in his way,—or what a dance he may be led, by one excursion or another, before all is over.” As digression follows digression, and interruption interrupts interruption, Tristram leads the tale on such a merry dance that it proceeds in every direction but forward. His reflections on matters mundane and philosophical and his accounts of the lives of his father and of his eccentric and often incomprehensible uncle Toby are just a few of the detours that distract him from his own progress, which never gets much past his first three years. But his wayward narrative’s energy never flags, and Sterne’s self-reflexive novel offers one of literature’s first—and probably its funniest—portrayals of the errant urgencies of consciousness. What: Novel. When: 1759–67.
