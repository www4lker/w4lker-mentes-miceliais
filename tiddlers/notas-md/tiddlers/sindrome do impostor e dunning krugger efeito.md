[[Síndrome do Impostor]]

> Os alunos ruins têm um tempo mais fácil na escola do que os bons alunos. Eles não têm que se preocupar em ler muito ou escrever bem porque podem simplesmente se ater ao básico e ainda assim se sairão bem.


> É normal sentir que você não é suficientemente bom, mesmo quando você é. Isto é chamado de síndrome do impostor. Os grandes realizadores muitas vezes se sentem assim porque sabem que há muito mais a aprender.


### How to Take Smart Notes
>Poor students do not have any of these problems. As long as they stick within the boundaries of their discipline and read only as much as they are told to (or less), no serious external system is required and writing can be done by sticking with the usual formulas of “how to write a scientific paper.” In fact, poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor students lack insight into their own limitations – as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison. That means that those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities. Poor students also have no trouble finding a question to write about: they lack neither opinions nor the confidence that they have already thought them through. They also won’t have trouble finding confirming evidence in the literature, as they usually lack both interest and skill to detect and think through disconfirming facts and arguments.

>Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven’t learned and mastered yet. This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are (Clance and Imes 1978; Brems et al. 1994).
