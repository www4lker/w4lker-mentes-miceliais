For web development, you'll need to focus on both front-end and back-end technologies. Here's a breakdown of the skills and technologies you should learn:

**Front-end development:**

1.  **HTML**: The foundation of web content, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure content on the web. You'll need to learn HTML tags, elements, and attributes to create web pages.
    
2.  **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style web pages. You'll need to learn CSS syntax, selectors, and properties to control the layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness of your web pages.
    
3.  **JavaScript**: As you've mentioned, JavaScript is essential for adding interactivity and dynamic content to web pages. You'll need to learn JavaScript syntax, data types, functions, loops, conditional statements, and DOM manipulation.
    
4.  **Responsive design**: Learn how to create web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and devices using responsive design techniques, such as media queries and fluid layouts.
    
5.  **Front-end frameworks and libraries**: Familiarize yourself with popular front-end frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build more complex and efficient web applications.
    

**Back-end development:**

1.  **Server-side programming languages**: Learn a server-side programming language like Node.js (which uses JavaScript), Python, Ruby, or PHP to handle server-side logic, data processing, and database interactions.
    
2.  **Databases**: Understand how to work with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Learn SQL (Structured Query Language) for relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
    
3.  **Web servers**: Learn about web server technologies like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS, and how to configure and deploy your web applications on them.
    
4.  **APIs and RESTful services**: Understand how to create and consume APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) using RESTful principles to facilitate communication between different parts of your web application or with external services.
    
5.  **Back-end frameworks**: Familiarize yourself with popular back-end frameworks like Express.js (for Node.js), Django (for Python), or Ruby on Rails to build scalable and maintainable web applications.
    

**Additional skills:**

1.  **Version control**: Learn how to use version control systems like Git to manage your code, collaborate with others, and track changes.
    
2.  **Testing and debugging**: Understand how to test and debug your code to ensure it's working correctly and efficiently.
    
3.  **Performance optimization**: Learn techniques to optimize your web applications for better performance, such as minification, compression, and caching.
    
4.  **Security**: Familiarize yourself with web security best practices to protect your applications from common vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection.
    
5.  **Soft skills**: Develop strong communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, as they are essential for working effectively in a web development team.
    

By focusing on these skills and technologies, you'll be well-prepared for a career in web development. Remember to practice by building projects and creating a portfolio to showcase your skills to potential employers.
