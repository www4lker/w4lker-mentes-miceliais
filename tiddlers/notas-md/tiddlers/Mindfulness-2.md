- Anagārika Munindra, my first teacher, had just returned from nine years in Burma and had begun teaching vipassanā, or insight meditation. When I first arrived, he said something so simple and direct that I knew I had come to my spiritual home: “If you want to understand your mind, sit down and observe it.” As he explained the practice, I resonated with this direct looking at the nature of the mind and body, at how suffering is created and how we can be free.

- We can also strengthen the quality of ardor by reflecting on the transiency of all phenomena. Look at all the things we become attached to, whether they are people or possessions or feelings or conditions of the body. Nothing we have, no one in our lives, no state of mind is exempt from change. Nothing at all can prevent the universal process of birth, growth, decay, and death. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=237))
- Mind is the forerunner of all things. Speak or act with an impure mind, suffering follows as the wagon wheel follows the hoof of the ox. Mind is the forerunner of all things. Speak or act with peaceful mind, happiness follows like a shadow that never leaves. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=318))
- Cultivating clear comprehension, knowing what we’re doing and why, is a profound and transforming practice. It highlights the understanding that mindfulness is more than simply being present. With clear comprehension, we know the purpose and appropriateness of what we’re doing; we understand the motivations behind our actions. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=337))
- Reflecting on the qualities of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha helps arouse confidence and faith in the mind, enlarging the context of our own particular struggles. We remember that all the ups and downs of practice are part of a much larger journey. On the night of the Buddha’s enlightenment, he overcame the armies of Māra, the forces of desire and aversion, restlessness and conceit. And every time we confront these very same forces in our own minds, we also are sitting under the Bodhi tree of awakening. We understand that the Bodhisattva’s struggle is our own. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=381))
- Ajahn Sumedho, one of the senior Western monks of the Thai Forest tradition, quite aptly pointed out that, contrary to some popular beliefs, our aim should be not to follow the heart but to train the heart. All of us have a mix of motivations; not everything in our hearts is wise or wholesome. The great power of mindful discernment allows us to abandon what is unwholesome and to cultivate the good. This discernment is of inestimable value for our happiness and wellbeing. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=424))
- Samādhi is based on skillful behavior, because without this basis in nonharming, the mind is filled with worry, regret, and agitation. When my first Dharma teacher, Munindra-ji, first visited America, he was struck with how people wanted to meditate and get enlightened, but seemed less concerned with this foundation of morality. He said that it is like trying to row a boat across a river, exerting a lot of effort in the process, but never untying the rope from the dock. It doesn’t go anywhere. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=496))
- Understanding deeply the truth of impermanence—not as a concept, but in direct experience—opens the doorway to ever-deepening insight. In the Buddha’s first teaching on selflessness to the group of five ascetics, he goes through each of the five aggregates — material elements, feelings, perceptions, formations, and consciousness — pointing out the impermanence of each and how that which is impermanent is inherently unreliable and unsatisfying. And that which is unreliable and unsatisfying cannot truly be considered to be “I” or “mine.” In just hearing this teaching, all five ascetics became enlightened. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=599))
- How does this happen? What is the liberating power of this teaching? When we see deeply that all that is subject to arising is also subject to cessation, that whatever arises will also pass away, the mind becomes disenchanted. Becoming disenchanted, one becomes dispassionate. And through dispassion, the mind is liberated. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=604))
- This insight is the first doorway into the understanding of selflessness, and in the stages of insight, it is called Purification of View. We begin to see that everything that we call self is simply this pairwise progression of knowing and object, arising and passing moment after moment. And we also see that the knowing in each moment arises due to impersonal causes and not because there is some abiding “knower.” So we can say that knowing (consciousness) arises spontaneously when the appropriate causes and conditions are present. Going even deeper, we see that the knowing faculty is not altered or affected by what is known, and this realization has liberating consequences for both our meditation practice and our lives. ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=668))
- It’s surprising that in our lives we often overlook the breath and that in our meditation practice we are sometimes bored by it. Not only is each breath sustaining our lives, but being aware and mindful of the breath was also the basis for the Buddha’s own awakening. It can be for our own awakening as well. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=949))
- Māra is the embodiment of delusion, and unlike the devil or Satan in some Western religions, who is considered lord of the underworld, in the Buddhist tradition, Māra is seen to be king of the highest heaven realm. His mission is to keep us all ensnared in his realm of saṃsāric attachments, and he uses many seductive and confusing ploys to accomplish this. ([Location 1084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1084))
- There is a story of one monk who every time he did something unmindfully would go back and do the action again. And after practicing this way for twenty years, he became an arahant. I like this story both for its suggestive practice and also because it speaks to a dedicated commitment to awakening. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1116))
- As we contemplate the body—our own bodies and those of others — from this perspective, both internally and externally, we also see the impermanent, contingent nature of all these anatomical parts. We understand that what we call body, that which we so often take to be self, is an interdependent system of organs, bones, blood, neural pathways, and other components. In contemplating this way, when some of these parts or systems wear out or stop working properly, we don’t take it to be some failure of self or some defeat of the body; rather, we understand it to simply be the nature of all conditioned things. It is precisely summed up in the second law of thermodynamics — the law of entropy, which says that all systems tend to disorder. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1159))
- We can also train in mindfulness of feelings with external situations. There is a story of Ajahn Chaa going on retreat by himself in a little hut in the forest, but not far from a village. One night, the villagers were having a celebration with loud music playing on loudspeakers. At first, Ajahn Chaa became annoyed, thinking, “Don’t they know I’m here on retreat?” But after a few moments of consideration, he realized the problem was in his own mind, not in the sound. He thought, “Well, they’re just having a good time down there. I’m making myself miserable up here. No matter how upset I get, my anger is just making more noise internally.” And then he had this insight: “Oh, the sound is just the sound. It’s me who is going out to annoy it. If I leave the sound alone, it won’t annoy me. It’s just doing what it has to do. That’s what sound does. It makes sound. This is its job. So if I don’t go out and bother the sound, it’s not going to bother me. ([Location 1465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1465))
- In our Western cultures, the idea of renunciation doesn’t always inspire us. We tend to think of it as deprivation, something that might be good for us in the end, but is not that much fun now. But another way of understanding renunciation is as nonaddictiveness to sense pleasures. From this perspective, renunciation holds out the possibility of happiness now. The less addicted we are to the seduction of sense pleasures, the less commotion there is in the mind. We experience greater ease and simplicity of living. ([Location 1495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1495))
    - Note: allan
- Why is there so much avoidable suffering in the world—violence, war, hunger, injustice—or in the difficulties of our personal relationships? That suffering is just these unwholesome mind states being acted out. For our own happiness and for greater peace in the world, we first need to know what is skillful and what is not and then to recognize all these states when they arise in the mind. The Dalai Lama emphasized the importance of this when he said that actions should not ultimately be measured by their success or failure, but by the motivations behind them. We can’t always, or even often, control outcomes, but we can train our minds and hearts. This is the training of the third foundation of mindfulness: mindfulness of mind. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1670))
- There are many examples of how we can develop wholesome mind states through practicing mindfulness externally. ([Location 1830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1830))

- On one of my stays at a meditation center in Burma, I met a friend from America who had already been living there as a monk for several years. It took some time for my mind to settle down, and when I observed how calm and concentrated my friend was, ([Location 1831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1831))

    - Note: inveja é a corrupção dos altos
- But after noticing this pattern with its attendant suffering, I started doing the meditation on muditā, or empathetic joy. This is the practice of wishing the happiness and success of others to continually grow and increase. It was surprising to me how quickly the mind shifted from the suffering of envy to the happiness of joy in my friend’s success. It was another lesson in the power of the practice to choose and cultivate what is skillful. It’s possible to change the channels of our minds.

- We can also learn from times when at first we’re not being mindful externally, but then, through our own reactivity, we become aware of what’s happening. ([Location 1845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1845))

- How do we react when we’re with someone who is angry or greedy? Are we simply noticing that those mind states have arisen in others, or is there some reactive charge in our own minds? ([Location 1847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1847))

- In practicing mindfulness internally, externally, and both internally and externally, we begin opening to the understanding of anattā, the empty, selfless nature of feelings and all experience. We shift our understanding from “I’m having a pleasant feeling” or “She is having a pleasant feeling” to “There is a pleasant feeling.” As Anālayo points out, in this contemplation, the boundaries of “I” and “others,” of separate selves, are left behind. It is the experience of phenomena independent of any ownership. ([Location 1855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1855))

- The second part of the refrain, as mentioned earlier with respect to the body and feelings, tells us to contemplate the nature of arising, of passing away, and both arising and passing away of the mind as it is conditioned by different states.

- We can contemplate the impermanence of these states in several ways. When we focus on their arising nature, we emphasize awareness of the moments when they first appear: anger arises, desire arises, calm arises. We can further understand the impermanent, conditioned arising nature of mind states by seeing what triggers them. We can notice the relationship of thought to emotion and emotion to thought, and how each can powerfully condition the other. For example, when people are on an intensive meditation retreat, many “time thoughts” will come to mind. If we’re calm or concentrated, the thought “another week of practice” might arouse the feeling of ardency or joy. Or if we’re struggling with some hindrance, the very same thought could trigger restlessness or loneliness. By noticing both the trigger thought and the resultant mind state, we are contemplating the arising nature of these states and stay free in the current of changing experience.

    - Note: Observar a mudança é a entrada para todas as formas de sabedoria.
- This bare awareness reveals a lot about the nature of the knowing mind. We begin to observe that bare knowing is effortless; it is the very nature of the mind itself. We can see this so clearly with sounds. When we’re undistracted and a sound arises, that sound is known spontaneously, effortlessly, and exactly. We don’t need to make an effort to hear it. This is the mirrorlike quality of the mind. We can also experience the same spontaneous knowing in movement. When we’re undistracted, the sensations of the movements are being known effortlessly. This bare knowing is not something we try to do or create; rather, it is something to come back to. A little mantra that has helped me a lot in my practice is a reminder ([Location 1900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1900))

- ABIDING INDEPENDENT This leads to the last line of the refrain, which summarizes the result of our practice: “And one abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world.” “Abiding independent” means not being dependent on objects of experience through desire or through the view of self, not identifying with anything as being “I” or “mine.” ([Location 1923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=1923))

- Together, the five steps outlined in this chapter further our understanding of the conditioned, selfless nature of all phenomena. All things arise when the appropriate conditions are present, and all things pass away as conditions change. Behind the process, there is no “self” who is running the show. ([Location 2071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=2071))
- The Dalai Lama often speaks about honoring one’s enemies because they teach us patience. This may be easy to agree with theoretically, but it is hard to do in practice. Notice the next time you’re having difficulty with a person or with a certain situation. Can you genuinely feel grateful to him or it for the opportunity to practice patience? Do we even remember to try? It’s easy enough to be patient when everything is going well. It’s precisely the times of difficulty that challenge us to strengthen this important factor. Remembering to make patience a practice helps loosen our attachment to our own views, our attachment to being right. ([Location 2211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=2211))
- There is a story in the novel Zorba the Greek, by Nikos Kazantzakis, about someone who saw a cocoon, and, thinking to help the struggling butterfly emerge, opened the fibers. But in doing so, the person removed the very struggle that was necessary for the butterfly to strengthen its wings and fly. The adage “The way out is through” can inspire our own efforts in challenging times. ([Location 2376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=2376))
- In ending, I wish that you continue your journeys and practice with much wisdom. Use the wisdom that you have already developed to persevere in practice. This can become the ground for your growth, for the deepening of yet greater understanding and love. Understand that you can deepen your practice in many ways. Don’t be lazy. If you find yourself lazy, then work to strengthen those qualities which overcome it. Don’t be fearful or timid. If you are timid in practice, then work with your mind so that you can overcome that. With the proper effort and with time, understanding will unfold by itself. But in all cases, use your own natural wisdom. This that we’ve spoken of today is what I feel is helpful to you, and if you really do it, you can come to the end of all doubt. You come to where you have no more questions, to that place of silence, to the place in which there is oneness with the Buddha, with the Dhamma, with the universe. And only you can do that. So do it, already. From now on it’s up to ([Location 2415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=2415))

- “Don’t check. Just go straight.” ([Location 2521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=2521))
- As we become mindful of these states of mind, rather than being lost in them, the mindfulness itself starts to bring the factors of concentration and energy into balance. This can happen in two ways. First, we can become mindful as if with a wide-angle lens. We settle back, aware of the whole body, just feeling and noticing the whole whirlwind of physical and mental energy. Sometimes I picture this hindrance as a Jackson Pollock painting, and mindfulness is the frame we put around it. The point of the frame is to help us see the picture more clearly. ([Location 2532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=2532))
- We can prevent the future arising of restlessness and worry in a variety of ways. From the moment we recommit to the sīla of nonharming, our mind settles into freedom from nonremorse. Even if we have done unskillful things in the past, as we all have, we know that from this point onward, we are taking care with our actions of body, speech, and mind. This, of course, is nothing more than following the eightfold path of practice, which we will explore in much greater detail in later chapters. Reading dharma books, conversing with good friends, associating with wise teachers — all help the mind to stay free from restlessness and agitation that have ([Location 2580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=2580))
- not yet arisen. ([Location 2585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=2585))
- The feeling tone is so important because it is the conditioning factor of our reactions. When we experience something as pleasant, we like it, and we want to hold on to it and have it continue. So we can see how pleasant feelings condition desire, craving, and grasping. When we experience something as unpleasant, we don’t like it, and we try to push it away and have it end. These unpleasant feelings thus condition aversion, anger, irritation, and fear. When we apply the Buddha’s teaching, “one knows, such is feeling, such is its arising, such is its passing away,” we learn both to recognize this feeling aspect more quickly and to see its changing nature. ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=2745))
- A powerful concept that often rules our lives is the concept of time, of past and future. But when we look carefully at how we experience what we call “time,” what do we find? Perception recognizes certain kinds of thoughts—memories, recollections, plans—creates the concepts of past and future, and then takes these concepts to have some intrinsic reality. But what is actually happening is simply different thoughts arising and passing in the moment. When we begin to see that our experience of past and future is just a thought in the moment, a huge burden is lifted from our lives. It doesn’t mean that we don’t use these thoughts skillfully; rather, that we’re not lost in our mind-created worlds. ([Location 2808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=2808))
- The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein expresses this succinctly when he says, “The sense of a separate self is only a shadow cast by grammar.” ([Location 3046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=3046))
    - Note: Here j goldenstein gift us with his knowledge in linguistics.
- One of the most freeing insights of meditation practice is realizing that the only power thoughts have is the power we give them. Yet they are tremendously seductive, particularly when they are intertwined with different emotions. Unnoticed thoughts have a compelling power in our lives; yet when we are aware of them, we understand them to simply be the play of the aggregates, impermanent and empty of self. Notice carefully the difference in experience between being lost in a thought and being aware of it. However long you may be carried away on the thought train, in those moments of waking up from being lost, open to that experience of wakefulness, that moment of recognition, without hurrying back to the breath or the body. This moment can reveal both the empty nature of thought and the illuminating power of awareness. ([Location 3167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=3167))
- In our practice we can watch for the arising of the fetters at any of the six sense doors. This is not an academic exercise. What the Buddha is talking about here is the arising and ending of suffering in our lives. This is made vividly clear in the third discourse the Buddha gave after his enlightenment, called “the Fire Sermon.” He was talking to a group of one thousand monks who had formerly been fire-worshipping ascetics, and so he used this theme because it corresponded with their own particular background. “Monks, all is burning. And what, monks, is the all that is burning? The eye is burning, forms are burning, eye-consciousness is burning, eye-contact is burning, and whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition — whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant — that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion; burning with birth, ageing, and death; with sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection and despair. . . . “The ear is burning. . . . The mind is burning. . . . “Seeing thus, monks, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye, with forms, with eye-consciousness, with eye-contact, with whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant; becomes disenchanted with the ear . . . with the mind. . . .

- When the mind is thinking or wandering . . . just be aware of it. Thinking is a natural activity of the mind. . . . You are doing well if you are aware that the mind is thinking. . . . But if you feel disturbed by thoughts . . . , or if you have a reaction or judgment of them, there is a problem with your attitude. The wandering mind . . . is not the problem. Your attitude that “they should not be around” is the problem. So understand that you have just become aware of some functions of the mind. These too are just objects for your attention.

- The second way we experience dukkha, the unsatisfying, unreliable nature of things, is through the direct and increasingly refined perception of their changing nature. As noted in chapter 31: Equanimity, many people have become enlightened by hearing just this one short teaching: “whatever has the nature to arise will also pass away.” But because this statement is so glaringly obvious, we often ignore or overlook its deep implications. Although we may not always feel this flow of incessant change as suffering, we still come to realize that nothing can be counted on to bring lasting fulfillment, precisely because nothing lasts. This great truth of change inevitably leads us to times of association with what we don’t want and separation from what we do. And these situations, in turn, often condition resistance to the unpleasant things that come and clinging to the pleasant ones.

- We can decondition, relinquish, and abandon craving through an increasingly refined awareness of the three characteristics. The more clearly we see the impermanence of all experience, the more we understand for ourselves the basic unreliability and ultimately unsatisfying nature of all phenomena. And through a sustained wise attention, we understand more deeply the selfless, impersonal nature of this whole unfolding process—that nothing lasts long enough to be considered “self.” These universal characteristics are the drawbacks, the dangers, the downsides of conditioned experience.

- People’s experience of stream-entry will vary greatly. The Abhidhamma, the Buddhist psychology, describes three different kinds of stream-enterers, the differences among which depend on the relative strength of the spiritual faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom.

- In this regard, the Buddha specifically mentions five kinds of livelihood to avoid: trading in weapons and instruments for killing; trading in human beings — buying and selling children and adults (although this may seem very foreign to most of us, unfortunately it goes on in many places in the world, even our local U.S. communities); avoiding livelihoods involving meat production and the killing of animals; manufacturing or selling of intoxicants or addictive drugs; and producing or trading in any kind of poison.

- At times, though, the hindrances may be tenacious, and we need additional strategies for abandoning them. In one sutta, the Buddha describes five techniques for dispelling distracting thoughts and unwholesome mind states. The first is using its opposite as an antidote. For example, if ill will has arisen, we can refocus the mind on mettā. Or if restlessness is present, calming the mind through calming the breath can be helpful. If envy or jealousy is strong, we can turn the mind to the feeling of muditā, empathetic joy. All of these remedies come from understanding that we have an inner remote control with an ability to change channels. ([Location 6271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=6271))
- The second means for removing unwholesome states already arisen is through the factors of hiri and ottappa, often translated respectively as “self-respect” and “respect for the wise.” These wholesome factors of mind bring a heightened sense of conscience and responsibility. Reflecting on how the wise might view an unwholesome mind state or activity is often a powerful ally in this endeavor to abandon what is unwholesome; for this reason, these factors are called “the guardians of the world.” Care is also needed here so that this review of our actions is done from a place of wise understanding and is not simply feeding into patterns of self-judgment or guilt. But used wisely, hiri and ottappa can awaken us from the power of deluded thinking. ([Location 6276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FYYXT9G&location=6276))
