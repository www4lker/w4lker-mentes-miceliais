Here are atomic notes based on the article "Psychogeography | Tate":

1. **Origins of Psychogeography**: The term psychogeography was coined by Marxist theorist Guy Debord in 1955. It was created to explore the effects of geographical locations on the emotions and behavior of individuals.

2. **Influence of Charles Baudelaire**: Debord's concept of psychogeography was inspired by the concept of the flâneur by Charles Baudelaire, a French poet and writer from the 19th century. The flâneur is an urban wanderer, exploring the city environment in a playful and inventive manner.

3. **Connection to Situationist International**: Debord was a founding member of the avant-garde movement Situationist International. This international movement of artists, writers, and poets aimed to break down the barriers between culture and everyday life. They sought a revolutionary approach to architecture that was less functional and more open to exploration.

4. **Roots in Dadaism and Surrealism**: The reimagining of the city proposed by psychogeography has its roots in dadaism and surrealism. These art movements explored ways of unleashing the subconscious imagination.

5. **Example of Early Psychogeography**: Tristam Hillier’s painting "La Route des Alpes" from 1937 could be described as an early example of the concept of psychogeography.

6. **Psychogeography in the 1990s**: Psychogeography gained popularity in the 1990s when artists, writers, and filmmakers such as Iain Sinclair and Patrick Keiller began using the idea to create works based on exploring locations by walking.
