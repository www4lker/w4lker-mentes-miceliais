1. **The chapter discusses the logic of care versus the logic of choice in healthcare**. The logic of care involves personalized advice that takes into account the patient's personal situation and priorities, while the logic of choice involves following a protocol based on clinical evidence. The chapter argues that the logic of choice may not always offer meaningful choices to the patient.
    
2. **The chapter explores the bureaucratization of healthcare delivery and its implications.** It discusses how technologies can substitute for certain types of interventions and how this can emphasize certain market logics. It also discusses the concept of "disruption" in the healthcare and wellness technologies markets.
    
3. **The chapter discusses the shift of labor costs to patients due to increasing reliance on self-serve technologies**. It distinguishes between expanding individual control and austerity-driven individuation, arguing that the latter can burden individuals with tasks that were previously handled by social institutions.
    
4. **The chapter encourages readers to question the healthcare institutions they interact with**. It asks readers to consider whether the technology they are being asked to use will truly improve their health or if it is merely shifting administrative or healthcare labor onto them.
    
5. **The chapter discusses access to self-tracking data**. It argues that access to such data is about who has the right to analyze the data and benefit from the answers. It presents the case of Dana Lewis and Scott Leibrand as an example of individuals who have provoked a public discussion about what level of access people should have to their own data.
    
6. **The chapter explores creative uses of self-tracking and the process of making off-the-shelf products work for individual situations or purposes**. It discusses the need to tinker with data to make it suit individual contexts and purposes.
    
7. ==**The chapter discusses five common styles or purposes for self-tracking**: monitoring and evaluating, eliciting sensations, aesthetic curiosity, debugging a problem, and cultivating a habit. It provides examples and practical aspects of tracking in each style.==
    
8. The chapter discusses the perceived burden to respond in some way when collecting data. It suggests resources to consider when stuck, such as nutritionists, naturopaths, mental health professionals, data coaches, disease-specific online communities, and local Quantified Self meetup groups.
    
9. The chapter concludes by looking forward to discussing the tools and devices used in self-tracking, as well as the industries producing them, in the next chapter.

**Chapter 1:**

- The authors introduce the concept of self-tracking and its cultural and social implications. They discuss their backgrounds and how they approach the subject from different perspectives. They also highlight the importance of understanding the social arrangements that influence the use and abandonment of self-tracking tools.

**Chapter 2:**

1. **Privacy in Self-Tracking:** Privacy in self-tracking is not protected simply because names and addresses have been stripped away from the data. Privacy is dependent on the specific context, and unexpected changes can yield a sense of violation. Institutions need to be sensitive to the social contexts in which they work and trace out the likely data flows.
    
2. **Data Ownership:** Data is never created by just one party. It comes into existence because there is a person who takes the steps, and because there is a person or company that has designed technology to represent those steps as data. The rights and responsibilities for data could be shared between the user and the company who makes the technology, similar to the rights and responsibilities of kinship.
    
3. **Access to Data:** The fight over access to data will continue as long as most companies and doctors default to a position that says data is a proprietary commodity for them to choose whether to make open. Clear statements from the public and policy statements about appropriate and inappropriate uses of data could change these practices.
    
4. **Data Privacy and Security:** Self-tracking tools will continue to raise privacy and security concerns as technologies evolve and new decisions are made about where data goes. There are technical challenges for privacy and security for self-tracking tools, and companies need to take these into consideration when designing their products.
    
5. **Use of Self-Tracking Data:** There is very little to stop third parties like insurance companies and employers from using self-tracking data to discriminate against the very people whose bodies generated it. To prevent this, people will need to speak up to ensure their interests are protected.
    
6. **Resources for Self-Tracking:** There are resources available for individuals who are self-tracking, including nutritionists, naturopaths, mental health professionals, data coaches, and online communities. These resources can provide additional feedback and support for individuals who are self-tracking.
    
7. **Collecting Data and Responding:** Collecting data creates a perceived burden to respond in some way. Experiments can and do fail, and choosing what you do not want to know is as important as choosing what to know. One successful resolution to a problem is to decide that it is not, in fact, a problem.


**Chapter 3:**

- The chapter discusses the social problems that may arise from self-tracking and how different communities are developing new practices and tools to address these issues.

**Chapter 4:**

- The chapter provides practical advice for setting up self-tracking experiments, including starting with brief experiments, focusing on one or two things, and being realistic about the work involved. It also discusses how self-tracking blurs the line between home and clinic and how regulation affects the relationship between medical practice and self-care.

**Chapter 5**: ?


**Chapter 6:** This chapter discusses the concept of self-tracking in relation to health and wellness. It explores how people use self-tracking to manage chronic conditions, improve their health, and make lifestyle changes. It also discusses the role of healthcare providers and the healthcare system in supporting self-tracking. The chapter highlights the potential benefits and challenges of self-tracking, including issues related to privacy, data accuracy, and the risk of over-reliance on data.

**Chapter 7:** This chapter delves into the social implications of self-tracking. It discusses how self-tracking can impact relationships, social interactions, and societal norms. It also explores the potential for self-tracking to exacerbate social inequalities and contribute to discrimination. The chapter emphasizes the need for ethical considerations and regulations to ensure that self-tracking technologies are used in a way that benefits individuals and society as a whole.

**Chapter 8:** This chapter explores the future of self-tracking. It discusses how advances in technology and data analysis could enhance the capabilities of self-tracking tools and provide new insights into health and behavior. The chapter also discusses potential challenges and risks, including issues related to privacy, data security, and the potential for misuse of data. It emphasizes the need for ongoing research and dialogue to navigate these challenges and maximize the benefits of self-tracking.

**Chapter 9:** This chapter reflects on the implications of self-tracking for individuals and society. It discusses the potential for self-tracking to empower individuals, improve health outcomes, and contribute to scientific research. However, it also highlights the challenges and risks associated with self-tracking, including issues related to privacy, data ownership, and the potential for discrimination. The chapter concludes with a call for individuals, healthcare providers, policymakers, and technology developers to engage in ongoing dialogue and collaboration to navigate these challenges and maximize the benefits of self-tracking.
