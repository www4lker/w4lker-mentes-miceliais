>The difference between Best of minimum and higher settings is the amount of tokens that the model must process in order to select the best output. In the minimum setting, the model will only process the minimum number of tokens necessary to select the best output. In the higher setting, the model will process more tokens in order to compare the different outputs and select the best one. This can lead to longer processing times, but it can also lead to more accurate and relevant results.
