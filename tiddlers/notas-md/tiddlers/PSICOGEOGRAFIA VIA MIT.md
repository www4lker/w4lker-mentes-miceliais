Here are some atomic notes based on the article "Psychogeography: A Purposeful Drift Through the City":

1. **Definition of Psychogeography**: Psychogeography is the study of the influence of geographical environment on the emotions and behavior of individuals. It involves the exploration of urban environments in unexpected ways, often through drifting or purposeful wandering.

2. **Origins of Psychogeography**: The term "psychogeography" was first used by the Lettrist International, a Paris-based collective of radical artists and cultural theorists in the early 1950s. They described it as a science of relations and ambiances.

3. **The Practice of Drifting**: Drifting, as recommended by the Lettrist International, is a practice of de-familiarization and the choice of encounters. It involves a sense of incompleteness and ephemerality, and a love of speed transposed onto the plane of the mind.

4. **Influence of Psychogeography on Contemporary Practitioners**: Contemporary practitioners of psychogeography take cues from Guy Debord, who proposed one of psychogeography’s first genealogies. They use the practice to reveal the city's underlying structure and to renew language, social life, and oneself.

5. **The Figure of the Flâneur**: Charles Baudelaire’s flâneur is often cited as a model for today’s psychogeographer. The flâneur was a dandy who ambled through the city streets, free from the pressures of the workaday world, seeking the random encounters that the city streets were always ready to offer.

6. **The Role of Walking in Psychogeography**: Walking has emerged as a means of reclaiming public space and as a process of self-education for many psychogeographers. It allows for close-up views that focus on the environment at hand and helps in detecting the sudden change of ambiance in a street within the space of a few meters.

7. **The Legacy of Psychogeography**: Psychogeography embodies the desire to renew language, social life, and oneself. For contemporary psychogeographers, the drift is purposeful; it can reveal the city's underlying structure. It often involves courting the unexpected and a strong emphasis on subjectivity.

8. **Remaking the World through Psychogeography**: Psychogeography allows for the remaking of the world in both photographic and material form. It acknowledges that the world cannot be recorded, it can only be remade, often done in smoke-filled cafés and through walking.
